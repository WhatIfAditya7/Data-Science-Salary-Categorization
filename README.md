# Data-Science-Salary-Categorization <br>
In this project, we will classify the types of salary in Data Science domain and convert a bad graph to a good graph. All the charts presented are interactive <br>

Identifying the two bad graph we have identified. The Two graphs are <br>

The second good graph is the salary of top two best data science job and using a jitter plot classifying the position levels. <br>

The third good graph is the best location for data science job. We have used Leaflet map to classify them. <br>

The fourth good graph is the distribution of male and female in the data science job. We have used a bar chart to classify them. <br>
